		<h1>Lab 12 - Loops</h1>
		<h2>Challenge/Purpose</h2>
		<p>Work with a partner and experiment with loops.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The problem that I had was having the program results to appear on the web page. I was only able to return the number 1 on the screen with the return statement, but the rest of the numbers & FizzBuzzBoom words just wouldn't appear at all. To solve my issue, I had to create a function for the output div and then put that function name at the end of the for loop. I also have to convert the numbers into strings so it can be shown along with the "Fizz", "Buzz", "Boom" strings.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>After resolving my issue, I was able to have the results appear on my web page and the programming works just fine. Another thing that I would want to work on is to put the results into columns so that we wouldn't be scrolling down on a long web page.</p>
